# library-management-system

This is a Tkinter based GUI for library management system. I have worked through all the features of the lms. Firstly one must create a new entry then it can be searched using the respective id. There is a limit of two books for issuing. the dates will be shown to submit the respective books. Returning of books is also very simple.
NOTE- The operation for fine amount calculation is not included in the program so it will not show the overall fine of the student.
